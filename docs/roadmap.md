## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal is to create a complete, modular electronics ecosystem built around small, flexible hardware modules and open firmware, including:

- General-purpose microcontroller boards  
- HID-focused input boards  
- Power management and charging modules  
- Sensor modules  
- Plug-and-play accessories  
- A unified Kjern SDK  

Kjern is committed to building a hardware platform that will grow year after year.
